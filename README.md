## Midi Input Recorder


</div>

### Description

NOW IT'S POSSIBLE ON VB!

This code INPUTS MIDI DATA, and echo it to a selected midiOut device. Nothing more. If you are not interested in MIDI PROGRAMMING, my advise to you is that, do not waste your time with this.

This was hard. BECAUSE: There is a callback function, which Windows calls many times during the recording. You can't find it on a documentation, as I could not. But now, here it is. I created it by looking to C related documents, and by using the 'AddressOf! operator of VB.

I don't understand why it is not running from VB, (It crashes)

run the .exe, or please compile it first, if you do not trust my .exe file.

Oxokl.
 
### More Info
 
Please run the EXE file, or compile it yourself again.

I don't know why, but VB crashes while running it.

But the compiled exe is OK.
